# Machine Learning Notebooks  

This repository contains my **Introduction to Machine Learning** notebooks, which were part of my course curriculum. The course is structured into **9 Course Outcomes (COs)**, covering fundamental ML concepts and practical implementations.

## Course Outcomes (COs)  

### **CO1: Introduction to Machine Learning**  
- Overview of ML, types of learning (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement).  
- Basics of Python libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.  

### **CO2: Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**  
- Handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling.  
- Feature selection techniques (PCA, LDA).  

### **CO3: Supervised Learning - Regression**  
- Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Ridge & Lasso Regression.  
- Performance evaluation metrics (MSE, RMSE, RÂ² score).  

### **CO4: Supervised Learning - Classification**  
- Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM).  
- Performance metrics (Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-score).  

### **CO5: Unsupervised Learning - Clustering**  
- K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN.  
- Evaluating clusters using Silhouette Score & Elbow Method.  

### **CO6: Dimensionality Reduction & Anomaly Detection**  
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-SNE.  
- Anomaly detection using Isolation Forest & One-Class SVM.  

### **CO7: Neural Networks & Deep Learning**  
- Basics of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Activation Functions.  
- Training neural networks using TensorFlow & Keras.  

### **CO8: Reinforcement Learning & Advanced ML Concepts**  
- Introduction to Reinforcement Learning, Q-Learning.  
- Ensemble Learning (Boosting, Bagging), Hyperparameter tuning.  

### **CO9: Machine Learning Applications & Case Studies**  
- Real-world ML applications: Healthcare, Finance, NLP, and Computer Vision.  
- End-to-end ML project with model deployment.
